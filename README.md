# AI Voice Assistant 🗣️

This project is an AI Voice Assistant that allows users to engage in voice-based conversations with an AI model. The system uses speech recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and text-to-speech technologies to provide a seamless and interactive voice assistant experience.

## Introduction

The AI Voice Assistant leverages Google Generative AI (Gemini Model) for generating responses based on user input. The system captures audio input from the microphone, converts it to text using Speech Recognition, and generates text responses using NLP techniques. It then uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to read the responses aloud, creating an engaging and natural conversation flow.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Captures user input through a microphone and converts it to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
- **Generative AI Response**: Uses Google Generative AI (Gemini Model) to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Converts AI-generated text responses back to speech using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, offering a clean and dynamic user interface.
- **Custom Styling**: Enhanced chat bubbles, custom scrollbars, and button effects for a visually appealing experience.

## Setup and Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-voice-assistant.git
   cd ai-voice-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure the `requirements.txt` file contains the following:
   ```text
   streamlit
   SpeechRecognition
   pyttsx3
   google-generativeai
   ```

4. **Set up your Google Generative AI API key**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** and generate an API key.
   - Replace the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` variable in `app.py` with your actual API key.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Open the application** in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:8501`.

3. **Click "🎤 Start Talking"** to start a conversation. Speak into the microphone, and the AI Voice Assistant will listen, generate a response, and speak back to you.
