Introduction
The AI Voice Assistant leverages Google Generative AI (Gemini Model) for generating responses based on user input. The system captures audio input from the microphone, converts it to text using Speech Recognition, and generates text responses using NLP techniques. It then uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to read the responses aloud, creating an engaging and natural conversation flow.

Features
Voice Recognition: Captures user input through a microphone and converts it to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
Generative AI Response: Uses Google Generative AI (Gemini Model) to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.
Text-to-Speech Output: Converts AI-generated text responses back to speech using the pyttsx3 library.
Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit, offering a clean and dynamic user interface.
Custom Styling: Enhanced chat bubbles, custom scrollbars, and button effects for a visually appealing experience.
